This development was done under the contract with Real Internet
Consortium (RIC) through Hitachi, Ltd., Japan.  

There was another HQLIP/SRSVP implementation developed by Prof. 
Fujikawa, Kyoto University, Japan. It helped me to understand 
the protocols.  

Also, there was a reference code to the QOS kernel developed by 
Prof. Matsuko, Hiroshima University, Japan. The work was quite 
excellent. 

Prof. Ohta, Tokyo Inst. of Tech., Japan, gave me advice. 

The protocols, HQLIP and SRSVP were developed by Prof. Ohta, 
Prof. Fujikawa, and Prof. Goto, Kyushu University, Japan with 
contributions from RIC members.

This development was led and managed by Prof. Jahanian, EECS, 
University of Michigan.
