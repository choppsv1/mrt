! ASExplorer, FlapGraph, and FlapTableDaily are the currently supported cooked
! data types. Each corresponds to one Java visualization tool.
!
! A command that begin with any of these applies only
! to that data type. All other commands are "global" -- they affect the
! operation of Data Distiller generally.
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
!
! Specify logging.
!   format: log <level> [logpath max-length]
!   log normal messages to /tmp/latest.log. don't exceed 100K for logfile
debug norm /tmp/latest.log 100000
!   also log trace-level messages
debug trace
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
!
! UII Configuration
!    which port to listen on?
!      format: uii_port <port #>
!      listen on port 5690
uii_port 5690
!    what's the password for access?
!      format: password <string>
!      password is CHANGEME
password CHANGEME
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
!
! Data Capture
! 
! peering -- who do we capture BGP traffic from?
!   who are we?
!     format: router bgp <local as number>
!     we are AS -5000 
router bgp -5000
!   who do we peer with, and where?
!     format: neighbor <ip addr> remote-as <as number>
!     peer with AS 0 at 192.168.1.1
neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 0
!     and AS -1000 at 192.168.5.5
neighbor 192.168.5.5 remote-as -1000
!
! storage -- where do we put the captures, and how often?
!   format: dump bgp updates <capture path>/<peering point>/bgp.%y%m%d.%H:%M
<interval>
!   store the captures in /bgpdata/mae-east, and dump the data every 15 minutes
dump bgp updates /bgpdata/mae-east/bgp.%Y%m%d.%H:%M 15m
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
! 
! "Gloabl" Configuration (affects all cooked data types)
!
! Tell Data Distiller where to find the datafiles.
!   format: database_directory <capture path>
!   our files are in /bgpdata.
!   (this is the same as capture path in "dump bgp updates".)
database_directory /bgpdata
!
! The data files that we read have their starting time as part of the filename.
! Data Distiller needs to know whether the time is in UTC or localtime.
!   format: filename_timezone_local {0|1}
!   filenames are in localtime
filename_timezone_local 1
!
! How much time is covered by each data file? 
!   format: file_timespan <interval (in seconds)>
!   This is the same interval as in "dump bgp updates", except that this must
!   be in seconds.
file_timespan 900
!
! If Data Distiller is publishing data frequently (as it is in this sample
! conifguration), then a significant amount of time will be spent reading
! directory information. This can be avoided by using the directory cache.
! Here we indicate how long the cache is considered valid (a value of 0 will,
! of course, effectively disable the cache).
! Be careful not to set this value to more than the bucket size for the
! FlapGraph/FlapTableDaily data (15 minutes), because you may miss updates if
! you do.
!   format: dircache_time <time (in seconds)>
!   invalidate the directory cache info after 5 minutes
dircache_time 300
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
! 
! ASExplorer Configuration
!
! In our installation, the BGP data files are placed in directories according to
! the peering point at which they were collected. But the ASExplorer tool
! would like to know which probe machine collected the data. We implement the
! mapping with these configuration commands. This is rather "cosmetic", and
! optional.
!   format:  ASExplorer probe_name <directory> <probe machine>
!   files in mae-east directory contain data collected by host rs2.mae-east.rsng.net
ASExplorer probe_name mae-east rs2.mae-east.rsng.net
!   files in mae-west have data from rs2.mae-west.rsng.net
ASExplorer probe_name mae-west rs2.mae-west.rsng.net
!   files in aads have data from rs2.mae-west.rsng.net
ASExplorer probe_name aads rs2.aads.rsng.net
!
! How often should ASExplorer cooked data be updated?
!   format: ASExplorer update_interval <interval (in seconds)>
!   update ASExplorer data every 60 seconds
ASExplorer update_interval 60
! ASExplorer generates summary information for a sliding window. Here we specify
! the window size.
!   format: ASExplorer report_time_range <interval (in seconds)>
!   gather ASExplorer data over the last 90 minutes
ASExplorer report_time_range 4500
!
! Where do we put the cooked data? There are two possibilities.
! We can either save the data in the filesystem, or we can feed it to
! the Dolphin server. Examples follow.
!
!   Output Method?
!   format: ASExplorer output_method {dolphin|files}
ASExplorer output_method files
!   Method specific configuration: files
!     Where to put the output files?
!     format: ASExplorer basedir <path>
!     place the files in /web/stats. as /web implies, this should
!     be a directory accessible to your webserver.
ASExplorer basedir /web/stats
!   Method specific configuration: dolphin
!     What's the hostname of the Dolphin server?
!     format: ASExplorer salamander <hostname>
! ASExplorer salamander nowhere.nil
!     What port is Dolphin listening on?
!     format: ASExplorer port <port #>
! ASExplorer port 8899
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
! 
! FlapGraph Configuration
!
! These commands are analagous to the ones for ASExplorer. See the ASExplorer
! example above for details.
!
FlapGraph update_interval 90
FlapGraph output_method files
FlapGraph basedir /web/stats
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
! 
! FlapTableDaily Configuration
!
FlapTableDaily update_interval 105
FlapTableDaily output_method files
FlapTableDaily basedir /web/stats
!
! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
! 
! Miscellaneous Configuration
!
! FlapGraph and FlapTableDaily data contain summary information about acitivity
! since midnight. This can be done based on localtime, or UTC. We recommend
! using UTC. (Note: this option is not independently configurable. The command
! can be issued referencing either FlapGraph or FlapTableDaily, but will affect
! both.) This option is primarily for backward compatibility with some internal
! tools. You should use UTC.
!   format: {FlapGraph|FlapTableDaily} use_localtime {0|1}
!   publish FlapGraph (and FlapTableDaily) data in UTC
FlapGraph use_localtime 0
!   equivalenty, we could have used FlapTableDaily use_localtime 0
!
